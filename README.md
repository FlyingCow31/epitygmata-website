# epitygmata-website
 My first projet: I'm trying to remake my website made on odoo with HTML, CSS and then JS !

You can find the original website, made with odoo (and by me) here: https://www.epitygmata.fr
The goal here is to remake it myself, to learn web development, and then publish it to be our new website.

-> I want to edit it a bit, so if you see something that's not the same or that's been deleted, don't worry
I just modified it. The main features will stay here tho.

I'm beginning with HTML, then switching to CSS and finishing with JS.
If you have any suggestions, there's my contact in my github readme.md ! 
You can also create a PR with the modifications/optimization (EXPLAIN THEM or I'll not accept them, I'm here to learn!)


project is moved here -> https://github.com/Epitygmata/officialwebsite
